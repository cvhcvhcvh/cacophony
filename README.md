## Background:

[Float](https://cvhcvhcvh.github.io/float/) is an interactive mindfulness app that helps users relax and alleviate stress through audio and visual decompression.  Users choose both temporal and thematic constraints based on availability so that maximum functionality can be achieved for each specific user.  Instructions on how to choose each time parameter and audio/visual cue will dictate the duration of the meditation.  A user can choose to float for 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes while also deciding between two distinct preset songs and backgrounds.  

## Functionality and MVPs:

* render instructions on how to "float" (choosing a set time and theme)
* allow the app to run for 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes 
* allow the app to display two different themes, each capable of running the duration of the chosen time
* allow the user play/pause functionality that pauses both the audio and visual components of the app

## Technologies and APIs:

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* SVG to incorporate functional buttons (play, pause, two different themes)
* Implementing .wav, .mp3, and .mp4 files
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source 
* JavaScript code npm to manage project dependencies
