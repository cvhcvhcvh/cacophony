## Background:

test

## Functionality and MVPs:

* render a blank coloring book image 
* incorporate a color palette with corresponding sounds
* paint with "sound color":  each click will initialize the sound
* once image is complete, be able to click around to play different sounds via a "solo" button or "play" the whole image as a loop via the play button

* Below the image will be the color palette 

* On the left will be the "solo" and "play" buttons


## Technologies and APIs:

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* SVG to create graphic illustrations of the coloring book
* Tone.js to grab a cascade of sounds for each individual color
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source 
* JavaScript code npm to manage project dependencies

## Implementation Timeline:

Monday: Setup project, try to learn NFL API, realize it's garbage and bail.  

Tuesday: Research SVG and Tone.js to lay framework for sound coloring; build out CSS map.

Wednesday: Pull sounds from Tone.js library and tie them to individual colors; make sounds play when color is chosen and applied to the image.  

Thursday: Finish logic for playing sounds, work on NavLinks.

Friday: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
